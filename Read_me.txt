Basic purpose of the development of an Android app is to control a multi-parameter device for environmental monitoring via Bluetooth (HC-05). The device is powered by a rechargeable power bank via USB (5V). The device can be used for field measurements to measure photometric, turbidimetric and fluorometric measurements.The principle of the photometric, turbidimetric and fluorometric measurements is based on a parameter specific LED and a light to frequency or light to voltage sensor which are attached to an Arduino Nano microcontroller.
The measurements and calibrations of each parameter are corresponding to the device, sample name, location (GPS), time, date, and value /concentration of the parameter, which is stored in a SQLite-Database on the device. The database can be extracted as Excel-File or csv-File and send via mail, etc. to the scientists. The microcontroller can be directly programmed via USB and the cc environment for Arduino. That's the only way to get the most from the microcontroller board. The sensors, LED's and sample cells are also available in a modular design and can be changed via magnets and cable clips. Each parameter is pre-calibrated, and a custom-defined 10-point calibration can also be done with the app
